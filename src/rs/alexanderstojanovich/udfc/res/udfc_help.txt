<html><b>- UNICODE DOOM FONT CREATOR </b></html>
    creates GZDoom font in newer format - 
    console font, small font, big font or big upper font    
    in zip archive (.pk3) file for GZDoom which needs to be included
    upon starting the game (Global.Autoload).
    UDFC creates GZDoom font from preexisting installed font on your OS
    (which came in True Type Font .ttf extension and are installed on the OS).
    Each character in the archive is one PNG file with features user chosen to be.
    Many features are available to the user, including:
    - Installed Font as a base,
    - Character range,
    - Character cell size multiplier,
    - Colors,
    - Palette,
    - Additional effects (gradient, outline and anti-aliasing).

    1. By clicking "Output Directory..." then "GO";
    2. By choosing "Export As..." in the file menu and then when file is chosen
       confirming it with output directory.
    Way (1) and (2) are alternative to each other and the outcome is the same 
    - one .pk3 file is generated.

    At any time user can stop the job by pressing "STOP" or in the file menu.
    Program is gonna stop at the next iteration and .pk3 archive will be created.
